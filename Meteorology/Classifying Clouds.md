# Classifying Clouds

* Clouds

  * Types and Recognition

## Background

Like sailing, soaring is a very weather dependent sport. Chapter 9 of the [FAA glider handbook][faa] goes into a
lot of detail with regard to how weather phenomena and gliding are connected (e.g., the various types of weather
driven lift that will keep you aloft). The METAR section (8.2) of the Meterological chapter of the [TC AIM][aim]
lists the following abbreviations as being used for cloud types in weather reports (METARs, TAFs, GAFs)

CI
 ~ cirrus

CS
 ~ cirrostratus

CC
 ~ cirrocumulus

AS
 ~ altostratus

AC
 ~ altocumulus

CU
 ~ cumulus

TCU
 ~ towering cumulus

NS
 ~ nimbostratus

ST
 ~ stratus

SF
 ~ stratus fractus

SC
 ~ stratocumulus

ACC
 ~ altocumulus castellanus

CF
 ~ cumulus fractus

CB
 ~ cumulonimbus

You will need to know these for the [TC glide exam][glide]. Both to be able to answer questions on the sample weather
reports and because there will likely be a question or two asking you to identify the cloud type in a picture.

This may seem like a lot, but in reality they are mostly Latin based desciptions, so they are just a few key parts
put together in different ways

cirrus/cirro
 ~ 

alto
 ~ 

cumulus
 ~ 

stratus/strato
 ~ 

fractus
 ~ 

castellanus
 ~ 

nimbus/nimbo
 ~ 

## Exercise

1. With the help of the UK MetOffice's [cloud types and pronunciations poster][clouds] fill out the following table
   for the cirrostratus, cirrocumulus, altostratus, altocumulus, stratus, and cumulus cloud types

   +------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |            |      low      |      mid      |      high     |
   +============+===============+===============+===============+
   | vertical   |               |               |               |
   | horizontal |               |               |               |
   +------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

2. Identify what bit of the Latin (if any) corresponds the English labels above

   low
    ~ 

   mid
    ~ 

   high
    ~ 

   vertical
    ~ 

   horizontal
    ~ 
   

3. What do the remaining terms indicate (this may take some googling)

   fractus
    ~ 

   castellanus
    ~ 

   nimbus/nimbo
    ~ 

5. Go to the [CloudLab][quiz] and attempt to classify the dominate cloud type in at least 20 pictures (click on the
   first cloud picture, pick you best guess in the bottom right box, click submit, see if you got it right, click
   the right arrow for the next one).

This last exercise is a good practice both for getting the TC glide exam picture-cloud-type question correct. It is
also the only real way I've found I've been able to get to the point where I can actually identify cloud types at
the field.  I found the fist several difficult, as reality seemed quite fuzzy compared to the ideals above, but I
started to get pretty good at it after a bit.
