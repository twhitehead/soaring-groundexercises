# METAR Decoding

Meteorology

* Aviation Weather Reports
  * Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)

## Background

Meterological terminal air reports (METARs) are an excellent source for weather information relevant to aerodrome
operations (e.g., takeoff/landing cross winds and height and coverage of the clouds).  The goal of this exercise is
to get you started decoding METARs as these are some easy marks on the exam if you do a bit of practice at it.

## Exercise

Complete the decoding of this METAR

it is true (implying spoken is magnetic).
