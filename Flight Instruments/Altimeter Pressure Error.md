# Altimeter Pressure Errors

Flight Instruments

* Altimeter
  * Principles of Operation
  * Errors

## Background

This question is intended to help make sure your understanding of how the altimeter works sticks in you head. Try
to do it first without going back and looking anything up. Research says struggling with something a bit is the
best way to get it to stick in your head.

## Followup

You have planned a full-day cross country flight. Before you take off, you set your altimeter to field height.

The weather report for the day said a low pressure region was expected to move into the area in the afternoon.

In the evening, on your way back to the field, given your understanding of how altimeters work, explain in a
sentance or two why you altimeter would be telling you

1. the correct height,

2. too high of a height (i.e., so you would actually lower than you would think looking at your altimeter), or

3. too low of a height (i.e., you are actually higher than you would think looking at your altimeter).

How might this affect your final glide decision (i.e., the point at which you stop taking thermals to replace lost
altitude and instead just concentrate on gliding the remaining distance to the field)?
