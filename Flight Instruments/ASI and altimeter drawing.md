# ASI and Altimeter Drawing

Flight Instruments

* Pitot Static System
  * Pitot
  * Static
* Airspeed indicator
  * Principles of Operation
* Altimeter
  * Principles of Operation

## Background

The purpose of this exercise is to discover how the altimeter and airspeed indicator work. This should also explain
the purpose of the ports we check for blockages in the daily inspection, why it would be bad if they were blocked,
and what sort of effect it would have on the aircraft instruments.

## Exercise

Draw a picture showing the sources of static and impact (a.k.a. stagnation or pitot) pressure and their attachments
(or not) to the airspeed indicator (ASI) and altimeter.  Explain, in one or two sentences each, how the ASI and the
altimeter use the pressures to produce the airspeed and altitude readings.
